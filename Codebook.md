
# DOWNLOAD THE DATASET

* For this project dataset is downloaded under the folder UCI HAR Dataset
* UCI HAR Dataset contained 6 datasets (x_train.txt, x_test.txt, y_train.txt, y_test.txt, subject_train.txt, subject_test.txt)

# Variable Allocation
* features = features.txt list of all features, corresponds to each column in x_train.txt and x_test.txt
* activities = list of activities performed, corresponds to each number in y_train.txt and y_test.txt
* subject_test = subject_test.txt: volunteer test subjects being observed
* subject_train = subject_train.txt: volunteer subjects being observed

# Project Analysis
### 1. Merging the training and test datasets to create one data set
      + X is generated by merging x_train and x_test through rbind()
      + Y is generated by merging y_train and y_test through rbind()
      + Subject is generated by merging subject_train and subject_test through rbind()
      + merged_data is generated by merging Subject, Y, and X through cbiind() 

### 2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
      + Tidy_Data is generted, selecting only those columns which have mean() or std() in their names

### 3. Using descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
      + code column in Tidy_Data is restored with the corresponding activity in the activities variable 

### 4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names
      + code renamed as activity
      + Acc renamed as Accelerometer
      + Gyro renamed as Gyroscope
      + BodyBody renamed as Body
      + Mag renamed as Magnitude
      + f renamed as Frequency
      + t renamed as Time

### 5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average        of each variable for each activity and each subject.  
      + Final_Dat is generated from Tidy_Data with means of each variable for each activity and subject
      + Store Final_Dat into Final_Dat.txt as the last step
